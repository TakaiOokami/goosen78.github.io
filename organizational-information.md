## Organizational Information Document

British Broadcasting Corporation is an UK based public service broadcaster. It is the world’s largest broadcaster employing over 22,800 people (BBC, 2013). Located in London, they hold a significant responsibility of providing public service broadcasting in the UK. Their mission is to “to enrich people’s lives with programs that inform, educate and entertain” (BBC, 2013). On 1 January 1927, The British Broadcasting Company was converted into the British Broadcasting Corporation operating under a Royal Charter Agreement as a public service broadcaster, which allows the BBC to be on sovereign editorial terms (Crisell, 2002). The BBC is mostly financed by license fees -- £145.50 since April 2010 -- charged to all UK households, companies and organizations using its services (PwC, 2015). Apart from eight national television channels and ten radio stations, the BBC includes other services such as BBC Online, BBC Mobile and various local radio and television stations, informing people around the world in over 30 languages.


The BBC has a sizeable presence in the UK media market, with 33 percent of the measured TV audience, about 25 percent of all TV channel/service revenue, 54 per cent of the measured radio audience, and a news and information internet site that is by far the most-used by UK media consumers (Ofcom, 2015c). Overseas, while smaller than many of its US led international rivals, the BBC is still the largest exploiter of UK originated intellectual property, and the only UK player to come even close to matching the leading US providers of content and content-based services (Ofcom, 2015c). It is also still a major player in global news provision through BBC World Service Radio, bbc.com and BBC World News. Moreover, it remains the best funded public service broadcasting organization in the world, although, the German PSB system receives more public money (Ofcom, 2015a).


This has led to the increasing influence many companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. New players such as Netflix are also making their mark. Overall this is leading to the consolidation of traditional platforms and content providers into powerful global groups including Sky Europe, Liberty Global, Comcast/NBC Universal, Discovery, the Walt Disney Company, and 21st Century Fox. All these companies have a significant presence in the UK and in the BBC’s major overseas markets. In the next decade these trends are likely to continue, potentially leaving the BBC smaller again in 2026 especially in terms of media consumption and revenue in the UK, and in its main overseas markets. Facing formidable global platform and content groups as both competitors and suppliers/distributors may especially prove difficult for the BBC.


While going forward, the BBC will face the pressures of globalization, fragmentation, consolidation and convergence as will its often smaller UK based commercial rivals in TV, radio, news and information. Three future scenarios are equally plausible for the UK’s commercial media sector. First, an “invasion scenario”, where most of the UK’s main commercial players end up being owned and operated by global media organizations – mostly from the USA – and whose behavior is driven more by global interests than UK consumer needs. Second, an “inevitable decline” scenario, where the commercial UK sector remains independent but becomes gradually weaker as it loses audience and revenue to global operators and rivals. Third, a “transformation scenario”, where the UK commercial media sector both diversifies and transforms itself to survive and then thrive in the global internet age. The size, scope and behavior of the BBC are likely to have a significant influence as to whether the third of these scenarios is the most likely. 


The BBC, now more than ever, needs to ensure their future if they are going to survive in the coming years. They must get the balance right between their mix of services including television, radio and online. An assessment of market impact and distinctiveness those provided by the UK commercial sector will also be crucially important to both the future relevance of the BBC and the health and fortunes of the UK’s commercial sector. In some areas, this may mean the BBC has to focus on cooperation with the commercial sector and on generating positive impacts for the commercial market rather than on just avoiding negative commercial market impact.

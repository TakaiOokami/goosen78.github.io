## Case Study Summary Document

IT projects tend to be cumbersome, time consuming, and costly for companies as well as an intense challenge for their project managers. With the recent spike in IT companies attempting to create, develop, and sell solutions to various markets, competition is fierce and new ground often contains footfalls unseen. Such was the case for the BBC’s Digital Media Initiative or DMI.  The initiative was supposed “to allow BBC staff to develop, create, share, and manage all video and audio content and programming on their desktop, and improve production efficiency across the BBC” (Charette) but the maturation of the project ended up being quite dismal.


From a business perspective, the idea of the DMI was very promising so the BBC pumped a lot of resources into it. Execution for the DMI began in January 2008. The “project was designed to allow BBC staff to develop, create, share, and manage all video and audio content and programming on their desktop, and intended to improve production efficiency across the BBC” (Charette, 2013).  This would allow multiple offices and organizations within the BBC network to openly share all forms of documentation, programs, images, files, and other assets to creative production.  In a sense, the idea can be likened to GitHub.  This million-dollar idea originally had a “projected net benefit of £17.9 million” (NAO, 2011). The justification for the initial cost was that DMI would create “dividend savings that would accrue from being able to reuse material instead of having to produce entirely new content” (Charette, 2013).  The idea of saving time and money greatly excited the BBC and they immediately made plans and promises to have the project out in no time.  The execution of the project was where the cracks began to show early on.


The DMI’s execution issues started with the BBC’s partners failing to deliver and only became worse when the company attempted to bring the project in house. The BBC partnered with the innovative solutions company Siemens to handle the technology side of the project.  Original contractual agreements stated that Siemens was supposed to have the technology side of the project completed “by May 2009, with an initial delivery by November 2008” (Charette, 2013), but less than a month into the project Siemens had pushed their initial delivery to February 2009.  In brief, Siemens still had naught to show and the contract between Siemens and the BBC was officially severed the 31st of July 2009.  This immediate delay cost both companies millions with the BBC only able to “effectively recoupe £27.5 million from Siemens” (Charette, 2013).  The BBC decided afterwards to take the project in house to see if they could make back more of the money they lost, but now they would have to “roll out DMI to 13 business units instead of the projected 6” (Charette, 2013).  Development continued in house all the way until 2012 “due to the variety and complexity of content because the project was more challenging than expected” (Coles, 2013). By this time, other off the shelf technologies were providing other BBC outlets with DMI capabilities at lower cost and higher functionality.  In the fall of 2012, the project was finally cancelled and total costs for the development were stated to be around £98.4 million.


The whole DMI project was riddled with failure.  The only product they were able to provide came out in early 2012 and it was already obsolete in comparison to other technologies available at the time.  Besides not being able properly create the product originally intended, the biggest failure could arguably be not knowing when to close on a failed project.  It is said that “group optimism (or hope) apparently outweighed hard-nosed business sense” (Charette, 2013) during the execution phase of this project and closing down earlier on could have potentially saved the BBC almost one billion pounds and about four years of development time.

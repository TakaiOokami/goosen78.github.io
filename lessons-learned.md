## Lessons Learned Document


Project Managers need a variety of skills in order to be successful. A project manager must possess technical knowledge and soft skills. To be a project manager, you must know how to be patient and have quick thinking. The first lesson learned from this report is simply to know when to ditch a project. The Digital Media Incentive literally wasted roughly £98.4 million which equates to about $150 million US dollars. This loss could’ve been avoided if the project was stopped prior to wasting more time and resources on it. The second lesson learned is contract management. As a project manager, you will be responsible with some contract negotiations or at the very least partially responsible. In this situation, the project manager may have cost his company to lose more money than necessary. There was no out in this contract or alternative that could have been enforced to minimize costs or mitigate risk. The third lesson is to narrow the scope of the project. The scope of the DMI project wasn’t specifically defined and this played a huge role in the downfall of the project.

### Lesson 1 – Quit!

The first lesson to learn from this project is simply to ditch a failure. When a project is failing, it is best to quit it and cut losses. According to cio.com, the “admitting project failure is never easy, but sometimes the kill decision turns out to be the best decision” (Edwards). The first sign that a project needs to be killed is that it is behind schedule. Siemens, the organization responsible for delivering the technology, failed to meet the initial delivery. In fact, Siemens failed to meet the delivery every time and were seeking a way out of the contract. According to the report, “both sides jockeyed over how to blame the other for the project’s delay” (Charette). When BBC elected to personally takeover the project, the damage had been done. The “DMI project was 21 months behind schedule which would change the project’s value for money proposition” (Charette). Throughout this case study, there were many times where the project was failing and the BBC seemed to insist on continuing with it. Ultimately, the project manager and leadership failed to mitigate the risk and stop the project before suffering losses.

### Lesson 2 – Bad Contract Negotiation

The second lesson is contract negotiation. The project manager in this case study did a poor job of contractually conducting this project.  According to the case study, the “BBC directly awarded a £79 million, fix priced contract to Siemens” (Charette). This very decision crippled the project before it even began. The project manager involved should have insisted on a non-fixed contract with pay being contingent on certain goals being completed. If there were safeguards put in place, then BBC would not have lost so much money, time and resources without being rewarded substantial compensation. BBC gave Siemens the upper hand with no repercussions for contract violations and Siemens took advantage of it. According to the case study, the initial delivery was supposed to be completed by February 2008 (Charette). However, they didn’t receive anything and the project was further delayed and subsequently led to each side blaming each other. The lesson to learn in this case is to be vigilant of organizations with bad intentions and be careful of the contracts that you sign or co-sign.

### Lesson 3 – Triple Constraint

The third lesson to take away is to properly manage the triple constraint of the project. The initial purpose of this project was to simply improve BBC’s international operations through the use of Digital Media Incentives Project. The scope was never clearly developed beyond that. Additionally, the bad contract situation led to the organization being put behind on the initial, prototypical stages of the project. The delayed situation led to the BBC’s project cost being inflated and they only managed to recoup £27.5 million from Siemens. According to the case study, the BBC’s “DMI project was 21 months behind schedule which would change the project’s value for money proposition” (Charette). Initially the BBC only planned to release 6 business units, but was forced to release up to 13 as a result of a new business plan. Subsequently, the project was further pushed back another 5 months. This project suffers from scope creep and the time, cost, scope, & quality all suffered as a result. The only aspect of the scope that was defined was the goal, but the steps in order to reach it were an enigma. Had the scope been defined and the triple constraint managed better, the project may have been successful.

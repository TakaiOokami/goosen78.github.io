## SCOPE

The project appears to be lacking in scope based on the BBC’s efforts to complete it. According to the British National Audit Office the BBC’s Digital Media Incentive (or DMI) was a technology that was meant to allow BBC employees to “develop, create, share, and manage all video and audio content and programming on their desktop” in order to promote efficiency(Charette). Although it seems like a goal, there are no specific goals specified in that statement. Furthermore, the fact that this project had a large lack of scope and direction can be seen from the aftermath very first project phase, when the NAO admits that it did not proceed “according to plan” ( Comptroller and Auditor General). However, the project continued anyway. The project severely suffered from a distinct lack of scope control which was likely one of the main factors causing the project to fail.

## TIME

The project had two different time constraints which perhaps made the constraint meaningless as time went on. The Siemen’s group was contracted to take care of this job by the BBC. They were meant to have an initial delivery of a product by November 2008, and by May 2009 they were supposed to be ready to roll out products. This constraint was almost completely ignored because by February of 2009, three months after an initial product was supposed to be brought out, the Siemen’s group had no product at all to speak of(Charette). The BBC canceled their contract with the Siemen’s group swiftly after that.

Next, the BBC attempted to fix the project by working on it themselves, however, they were 21 months behind schedule at this point. Therefore, the overall project time constraint was increased by two years from their initial final project date of March 2015. September 2015, the time constraint was increased once again by five months. Now the initial delivery was planned for the summer of 2011. October of 2012 the project was paused and then canceled altogether(Charette).

Overall, the time constraint was ignored or increased so many times that it became meaningless in the end

## COST

The initial cost for the project was included as a part of a fixed price the BBC had with Siemens of 79 million. The resulting total cost of the project initially was 81.7 million, with a predicted benefit of 99.6 million. Therefore, the payoff would be nearly 18 million. However, after the Siemens group revealed they were behind schedule, the cost would now total 105.1 million with a payoff of -31 million. In other words, they would be at a loss if they continued the project(Charette). It was here and now that the BBC should have cut their losses on the project and canceled it altogether.

However, the project continued and the BBC reached a settlement with the Siemens group of 27.5 million when they canceled their contract and made a new budget plan for the DMI project. The new budget totaled 133.6 million. Even if you subtract the money won back from Siemens, this still results in a whopping 106.1 million investment. The payoff now was calculated to be at a loss of 8.2 million, and this included over double of the planned business units to be rolled out. Once again, this was a sign to the BBC that they should cut their losses. However, in February of 2011, the head of the National Audit office (NAO), Amyas Morse, said “that the ‘early stages of the Programme was disappointing and did not achieve value for money…’” but claimed that the real value of the project lay in the productivity resulted by the users, and therefore that it was still too early to tell if the project was dead or not(Charette).

By the time 2013 rolled around and the BBC finally agreed that the project needed to be scrapped, they had to accept a total loss of 98.4 million because no one kept the project’s cost in check(Charette).
